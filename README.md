Abstract:

This Project introduces a new approach in augmenting Surya Namaskar, yoga practices, and
exercises through the combination of JavaScript, Machine Learning, and some other technical
frameworks. It uses deep learning algorithms and a convolution neural network(CNN). Our web-
based application offers real-time, precise identification of Surya Namaskar poses, Yoga postures,
and exercise regimes elevating the traditional yoga and workout experience. Our methodology
uses the ml5js library that allows us to use machine learning in JavaScript which is best integrated
into web applications, this provides rapid pose detection with high accuracy. The model provides
supervised recognition and auto-pose detection. this research presents a comprehensive exploration
of the technological advancements, design principles, and implementation intricacies that underpin
the combination of machine learning and healthcare. The outcomes showcase a transformative tool
for yoga practitioners, providing personalized guidance, and corrective feedback. The model is also
useful for normal workouts providing a wide range of exercises along with calorie burn calculations
with precise report generation with logs of each session
